# Visualizing Neural Network approximations
In these example notebooks it is possible to visualize how a neural network learns to approximate a given function.

Itstartsby setting up the problem and defining the function to approximate. After that, a classical machine learning approach is used to obtain a baseline solution.
The, increasingly large neural networks are trained and their results ploted and compared to analyze the way that the network is learning from the data.
